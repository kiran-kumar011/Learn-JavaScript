// Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.

// Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.(what is element in the function)



// Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

function palindrome(txt){
	var length = txt.length;
	if(txt[0] === txt[txt.length-1] && txt[1]===txt[txt.length-2]){
		return`it is a palindrome`;
	}
} 

// Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.
